# Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model

- For given $(r_{t},w_{t})$, household $i$ chooses a policy to maximize
$$
    E_{0} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t} u(c_{t})
$$
subject to
$$
    c_{t} + a_{t+1} \leq (1+r_{t}) a_{t} + w_{t} e_{t}
$$

$c_{t}$ is consumption, $a_{t}$ is asset holding, $e_{t}$ is employment status.
